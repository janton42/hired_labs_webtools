Bullet Model 1:
	model_name = raw_rf (raw features using a Random Forest classifier)
	Validation Set Results:
		Accuracy: 0.906
		Precision: 0.914
		Recall: 0.86
		Latency: 0.129ms

	Test Set Results:
		Accuracy: 0.93
		Precision: 0.928
		Recall: 0.877
		Latency: 0.038ms

Name Model:
	model_name = all_gb (all features using Gradient Boosting)

	Validation Set Results:
		Accuracy: 0.986
Precision: 0.987
Recall: 0.962
Latency: 0.003ms
	
	Test Set Results
	Accuracy: 1.0
Precision: 1.0
Recall: 1.0
Latency: 0.003ms

Bullet Model 2:
	Records and features were added for the Name model, so this model was rerun using the new features
	model_name = reduced_gb (a reduced set of features using Gradient Boosting)
	reduced_features = ['stopword_percentage','word_count', 'proper_noun_percentage','verb_percentage']
	Validation Set Results:
		Accuracy: 0.933
		Precision: 0.878
		Recall: 0.889
		Latency: 0.004ms
	Test Set Results:
		Accuracy: 0.929
		Precision: 0.909
		Recall: 0.811
		Latency: 0.003ms
