19,Create a Strong Resume 
20,A 
21,"resume  is  a  concise,  informative  summary "
22,"of your abilities, education, and experience. "
23,"It should highlight your strongest assets and skills, "
24,and differentiate you from other candidates seek- 
25,ing similar positions. Although it alone will not get 
26,"you a job or internship, a good resume is an impor- "
27,tant element toward obtaining an interview. 
28,Tailor  your  resume  to  the  type      of      position 
29,you  are  seeking.  This  doesn’t  mean  that  all  of 
30,"your  experiences  must  relate  directly,  but  your "
31,resume  should  reflect  the  kind  of  skills  the 
32,employer would value. 
33,GETTING STARTED 
34,•  Draft a resume using one of the templates on the OCS website. 
35,•  Attend a Resume Workshop to learn the nuts and bolts of getting 
36,started. See the OCS website for dates. 
37,•  View the OCS Recorded Resume Webinar available on our website. 
38,"•  Get advice via drop-ins. Monday-Friday, 1:00-4:00pm - ask quick "
39,career-related questions and have an adviser review your resume. 
40,"•  Look for industry specific resume review clinics, listed on the "
41,Employer and Graduate School Calendar. 
42,RESUME TIPS 
43,TOP 6 RESUME MISTAKES: 
44,RESUME LANGUAGE SHOULD BE: 
45,• Specific rather than general 
46,• Active rather than passive 
47,• Written to express not impress 
48,• Articulate rather than “flowery” 
49,• Fact-based (quantify and qualify) 
50,• Written for people who scan quickly 
51,DON’T: 
52,• Use personal pronouns (such as I) 
53,• Abbreviate 
54,• Use a narrative style 
55,• Use slang or colloquialisms 
56,• Include a picture 
57,• Include age or gender 
58,• List references 
59,• Start each line with a date 
60,1.  Spelling and grammar errors 
61,2.  Missing email and phone information 
62,3.  Using passive language instead of “action” words 
63,"4.  Not well organized, concise, or easy to skim "
64,5.  Not demonstrating results 
65,6.  Too long 
66,DO: 
67,• Be consistent in format and content 
68,"• Make it easy to read and follow, balancing white "
69,space 
70,"• Use consistent spacing, underlining, italics, bold, "
71,and capitalization for emphasis 
72,• List headings (such as Experience) in order of 
73,importance 
74,"• Within headings, list information in reverse chron- "
75,ological order (most recent first) 
76,• Avoid information gaps such as a missing summer 
77,• Be sure that your formatting will translate properly 
78,if converted to a .pdf

657,activities that were engaging and tailored to my students' needs. 
658,"Additionally, in my role as the Director of Marketing for the Social Innovation Collaborative, I "
659,led our team in creating a social media strategy to drive our member recruitment efforts and 
660,"promote our programs and events on platforms including Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. "
661,"With so many competing events on campus each day, I had to continually be creative in my "
662,approach to developing and delivering content that would be compelling and effective. As a 
663,"result of my efforts, our group experienced a 20% increase in our membership base and a 15% "
664,increase in our social media engagement. I’m excited at the prospect of bringing the skills I 
665,developed through this experience to the Marketing and Communications role at Jumpstart.
