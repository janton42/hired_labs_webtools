RESUMES  AND  COVER  LETTERS  

Create a Strong Resume 

A 

resume  is  a  concise,  informative  summary 
of your abilities, education, and experience. 
It should highlight your strongest assets and skills, 
and differentiate you from other candidates seek- 
ing similar positions. Although it alone will not get 
you a job or internship, a good resume is an impor- 
tant element toward obtaining an interview. 

Tailor  your  resume  to  the  type      of      position 
you  are  seeking.  This  doesn’t  mean  that  all  of 
your  experiences  must  relate  directly,  but  your 
resume  should  reflect  the  kind  of  skills  the 
employer would value. 

GETTING STARTED 

•  Draft a resume using one of the templates on the OCS website. 
•  Attend a Resume Workshop to learn the nuts and bolts of getting 

started. See the OCS website for dates. 

•  View the OCS Recorded Resume Webinar available on our website. 
•  Get advice via drop-ins. Monday-Friday, 1:00-4:00pm - ask quick 
career-related questions and have an adviser review your resume. 

•  Look for industry specific resume review clinics, listed on the 

Employer and Graduate School Calendar. 

RESUME TIPS 

TOP 6 RESUME MISTAKES: 

RESUME LANGUAGE SHOULD BE: 
• Specific rather than general 
• Active rather than passive 
• Written to express not impress 
• Articulate rather than “flowery” 
• Fact-based (quantify and qualify) 
• Written for people who scan quickly 

DON’T: 

• Use personal pronouns (such as I) 
• Abbreviate 
• Use a narrative style 
• Use slang or colloquialisms 
• Include a picture 
• Include age or gender 
• List references 
• Start each line with a date 

1.  Spelling and grammar errors 
2.  Missing email and phone information 
3.  Using passive language instead of “action” words 
4.  Not well organized, concise, or easy to skim 
5.  Not demonstrating results 
6.  Too long 

DO: 
• Be consistent in format and content 
• Make it easy to read and follow, balancing white 

space 

• Use consistent spacing, underlining, italics, bold, 

and capitalization for emphasis 

• List headings (such as Experience) in order of 

importance 

• Within headings, list information in reverse chron- 

ological order (most recent first) 

• Avoid information gaps such as a missing summer 
• Be sure that your formatting will translate properly

RESUMES  AND  COVER  LETTERS  

Write an Effective Cover Letter 

Your  cover  letter  is  a  writing  sample  and  a  part  of  the  screening  process.  By  putting  your  best  foot  forward,  you  can  increase  your 
chances of being interviewed. A good  way  to  create  a  response-producing  cover  letter  is  to  highlight  your  skills  or  experiences 
that are most applicable to the job or industry and to tailor the letter to the specific organization to which you’re applying. 

Use complete 
title and address  
(street address is  
optional if space  
is limited). 

Address to a 
particular person 
if possible and 
remember to use 
a colon. 

Persuade the  
addressee to read  
your resume. 
Be brief, but  
specific. 

Remind the 
reader of what 
you can do for 
the organization.

Dear 

: 

Opening paragraph: Clearly state why you’re writing, name the 
position or type of work you’re exploring and, where applicable, how 
you heard about the position or organization. A summary statement 
may work well here by including three reasons you think you would be 
a good fit for the opportunity. 

Middle paragraph(s): Explain why you are interested in this employer 
and your reasons for desiring this type of work. If you’ve had relevant 
school or work experience, be sure to point it out with one or two key 
examples; but do not reiterate your entire resume. Emphasize skills or 
abilities that relate to the job. Be sure to do this in a confident manner 
and remember that the reader will view your letter as an example of 
your writing skills. 

Closing paragraph: Reiterate your interest in the position, and 
your enthusiasm for using your skills to contribute to the work 
of the organization. Thank the reader for their consideration of 
your application, and end by stating that you look forward to the 
opportunity to further discuss the position. 

Sincerely, 

Your name typed 

Some general rules about letters: 

• Address your letters to a specific person if you can. 
• Tailor your letters to specific situations or organizations by 

doing research before writing your letters. 

• Keep letters concise and factual, no more than a single page. 

Avoid flowery language. 

• Give examples that support your skills and qualifications. 
• Put yourself in the reader’s shoes. What can you write that will 
convince the reader that you are ready and able to do the job? 

• Don’t overuse the pronoun “I”. 

• Remember that this is a marketing tool. Use plenty of action 

words. 

• Have an OCS adviser provide feedback on your letter. 
• If converting to a .pdf, check that your formatting translates 

correctly. 

• Reference skills or experiences from the job description and 

draw connections to your credentials. 

• Make sure your resume and cover letter are prepared with the 

same font type and size.

Morgan Smith 
Director of Communications 
Jumpstart 
308 Congress Street, 6th Floor 
Boston, MA 02110 

Dear Morgan Smith: 

I am a senior at Harvard College studying History and Literature.  I am writing to apply for the 
Marketing and Communications position at Jumpstart posted in Harvard’s Crimson Careers 
database.  I am excited about the field of education, and would welcome the opportunity to bring 
my strong communication skills, creativity, and marketing experience to your growing team. 

Jumpstart's commitment to early education for every child is of particular interest to me because 
of my passion for youth development. This past summer, I worked as a senior counselor in the 
Summer Urban Program, which is dedicated to preventing summer learning loss for children in 
the Boston and Cambridge area. I designed and taught fun, interactive classes to a group of 10 
fifth graders, and planned and led local field trips and workshops daily with a junior counselor. 
Throughout the summer, I consistently strived to create math, science, and reading lessons and 
activities that were engaging and tailored to my students' needs. 

Additionally, in my role as the Director of Marketing for the Social Innovation Collaborative, I 
led our team in creating a social media strategy to drive our member recruitment efforts and 
promote our programs and events on platforms including Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. 
With so many competing events on campus each day, I had to continually be creative in my 
approach to developing and delivering content that would be compelling and effective. As a 
result of my efforts, our group experienced a 20% increase in our membership base and a 15% 
increase in our social media engagement. I’m excited at the prospect of bringing the skills I 
developed through this experience to the Marketing and Communications role at Jumpstart. 

Thank you for your consideration.  I very much look forward to the opportunity to speak with 
you in person about my interest in this position. 

Sincerely, 

Alex Crimson
